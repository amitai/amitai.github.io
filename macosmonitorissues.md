List to keep track so that when I complain about macOS multi monitor I remember
my reasons.

## If set as "monitors have separate spaces"
- When you drag a window from one monitor to another there's some "dead spot"
where if you drop the window there in between it straight up disappears and
you need to get it back via mission control or whatever. 

- Can't have a window stretch across multiple monitors.

## If not set as "monitors have separate spaces"
- If you fullscreen an app it blanks out the other screen

- Menu bar only shows up on one monitor

## General

- MacBook Pro with M3 chip [can only support one external display](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213503)!  

- Cannot remember window or app position.  For example: open a file in 
Preview, drag it to the other screen, close the window, open another
file, it opens back in the other place.  Need to use software like
Stay to fix.

- Can't do two video outs on one usbc. 

- thing about spaces.

- menu bar disappears when you have certain apps full screen on another monitor.  This isn't all apps and apparently
has to do with how full screen is implemented in that app. It happens in Firefox and Serato DJ Pro among others.

- Can't disable internal monitor (if you want to JUST use external monitor)

- On [hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31361974) a lot of people are saying if you have more than one external monitor then there's a bunch of problems, forgetting order, etc. I only use one external monitor so I don't know about these problems. also on that thread someone said don't give monitors separate spaces to fix some of my other problems.

- Universal Access keeps resetting.

- Dialog boxes pop up on the screen you have focus on regardless of where the window is.

- Turning off one monitor will make macos think the monitor is disconnected and reshuffle all the windows onto the other monitor
